#GlitchCam
Glitch Cam is my version of WebCam Fun of 30days of Javascript Challenge. 
In order for this to work correctly you need to allow the app to use your camera. 
Light the bulb ,move the sliders to see the green screen effect. Click the Small camera to take a photo and download it. 
Few Updates are comming.

Update 26.05:
Some bug accured during last merge which made "green screen effect" stopped working. Going to fix this as soon as possible.
